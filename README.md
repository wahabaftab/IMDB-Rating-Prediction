# IMDB-Rating-Prediction
This is a beginners code for basic machine learning tasks. It gives a basic understanding of how to perform EDA and make predictions using pandas and sklearn.

I rate movies and seasons on IMDB, I've scrapped data of all the movies and seasons I've rated (currently 600) to train and predict future movies/seasons.
